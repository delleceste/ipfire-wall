<h3>Kernel memory usage for internal tables</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

This plot displays the <em>kernel memory usage over time</em>. <strong>Five</strong> curves are 
drawn on the graph:
<ul>
<li><strong>state tables</strong> curve: depicts the memory usage, in <em>kilobytes</em> of the <strong>state tables</strong>
 loaded into the kernel by the firewall. If <strong>allowed traffic</strong> is mainly managed by <strong>stateful rules</strong>,
 then this curves indicates the trend of the allowed traffic against time;</li>
 
<li><strong>source nat tables</strong> curve: depicts the memory usage, in <em>kilobytes</em> of the <strong>source nat tables</strong>
 loaded into the kernel by the firewall. Also <strong>masqueraded packets</strong> pertain  to this trend;</li>
 
<li><strong>destination nat tables</strong> curve: depicts the memory usage, in <em>kilobytes</em> of the <strong>destination nat tables</strong>
 loaded into the kernel by the firewall;</li>
 

<li><strong>log info tables</strong> curve: depicts the memory usage, in <em>kilobytes</em> of the <strong>log info tables</strong>
 loaded into the kernel by the firewall. High values for this quantity reveal high activity of the firewall 
 <a href="action://showconsole" title="Go to the firewall console">console</a>. <br/>To reduce this value, enable 
 <em>silent modality</em>, if you are not interested in reading the firewall activity through the console, or decrease
 the log entries lifetime in the advanced settings of the firewall (root only);</li>
 
 <li><strong>total</strong> curve: represents the <em>sum</em> of the values of the other curves and reveals the total 
  memory in use for the firewall dynamic tables.</li>
 
</ul>

</p>

<p>
  These curves, especially the <strong>state tables</strong> one, reveal the firewall activity and the number of 
  connections managed by the firewall, particularly the allowed traffic (state tables). The quantity of memory used
  by the kernel for these tables varies in time in consequence of the network activity. 
  <br/><strong>Note</strong>: file sharing applications open a great number of connections and might produce elevated 
  values of the curves.
</p>

<h3>Displaying details on curve values</h3>
<p>
  Click with the <cite>left button</cite> of the mouse on a point of the plot near a curve to display a 
  marker with the details of the closest point of the closest curve.
</p>
<p>
  Zoom is available on the plot too. Select a region with the mouse left button pressed and then release the
  mouse button to plot the selected area.
