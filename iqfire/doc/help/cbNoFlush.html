<h3>Leave rules loaded at exit</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
If you enable this feature, then when <strong>ipfire-wall or iqfire-wall</strong> 
exits, it leaves all the rules loaded into the kernel, including the kernel module.

</p>

<p>
	Note that this option is fundamental to let the other users configure 
	the firewall by themselves, while respecting the <strong>administrator's</strong>
	decisions.
</p>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
	This option affects also the command line interface <strong>ipfire-wall</strong>.
	<br/>
	If you leave the rules loaded, then each unprivileged user's rule will be 
	added to the end of the root ruleset, thus granting the administrator's 
	policies to have the first priority.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, if this feature is disabled, when the user interface is turned off
	all the rules are removed and this means:
	<ul>
	<li>no rules are loaded: the default policy (normally <strong>block</strong>) is applied;</li>
	<li>every normal user can add his own rules (if allowed in the check box above) and they will be
		the only rules consulted. </li> 
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Important note</h3>

<p>
	It is important that the administrator configures the firewall <em>as root</em> 
	only adding the policies strictly affecting the <em>system services that require 
	a network connection and the other fundamental services which <strong>in every 
	circumstance</strong> he wants to be applied, let's say from system startup to
	system shutdown</em>.
	
</p>

<p>
	For every other kind of service, especially those specific to the normal 
	users of the computer, let each unprivileged user configure his own policies.<br/>
	Moreover, normal user's policies <strong>are always removed from the firewall</strong>
	when the user interface (be it <em>ipfire-wall or iqfire-wall</em>) is turned off.
