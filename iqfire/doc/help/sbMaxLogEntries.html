<h3>Maximum number of log entries</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Click on the arrows or type a number to set the maximum number of 
log entries that the kernel can create to communicate with the 
user space.

	The considerations about this parameter are completely analogous to those 
	discussed for <em>state and NAT</em> tables, although they have no impact 
	at all on the <em>packet filtering and NAT</em>, because they only concern 
	the information flow between user and kernel spaces.
