<h3>Normal users can configure the firewall</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

A key feature of <em>ipfire-wall/iqfire-wall</em> is the possibility to allow 
any unprivileged user of the machine to configure the firewall.

</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>root</strong>'s policies are loaded <strong>before</strong> the rules 
		of the unprivileged user. This means that the normal users' rules are 
		evaluated <strong>after</strong> the root's ones, and so have a <strong>
		lower priority</strong>;</li>
	<li>a normal user <strong>cannot delete nor modify root's policies</strong>.</li>
	
	
</ul>

<p>
	As a natural consequence, <em>if the administrator permits a connection, a normal user 
	can decide, for his own safety reason, to block it</em>, but <em>if root blocks a 
	connection, a normal user cannot allow it</em> because the firewall <strong>first 
	scans and apply the explicit denial rules and then the permission ones</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	Notwithstanding these important secure approach, the administrator is able to
	 avoid a normal user personalizing the firewall with his own rules.
</p>	

<p>
	On the other hand, if the computer is for personal/familiar use, there ideally be 
	just a few administrator's rules and many normal user defined policies.
</p>

<p>
	An idea could be to adopt the <em>default installation configuration</em>, which contains 
	a basic permission ruleset for an average user which navigates the web, reads the email, 
	eventually connects to an <em>ssh server</em>, and to add by normal user account all the rest.
<p>

<p>
	Another interesting scenario could be represented by a parent that, as root, configures a safe 
	network environment and lets his children use and safely configure <em>iqfire-wall</em>,
	while learning <em>linux internetworking</em>.
