<h3>Delay of info and help messages</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

When you move your mouse over (almost) any element of the user interface,
 an associated <em>help and info</em> message is displayed.
To improve the usability, it is better to setup a little time interval between the 
mouse <em>stop over a widget</em> and the <em>message display</em> on the panels.
Tune this interval according to the one with which you feel more confortable to 
navigate through the interface elements.
