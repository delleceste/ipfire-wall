<h3>The ICMP protocol</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
The <strong>ICMP</strong> protocol is the acronym of <em>Internet Control Message Protocol</strong> and it is mainly 
 used by networked computers' operating systems to send error messages indicating, for instance, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.<br/>
Enabling this protocol, will allow such kind of messages to be sent and/or 
received by your <em>linux</em> box.
A typical use of the <strong>icmp</strong> protocol is made by the 
program <strong>ping</strong>, which sends over the internet the 
<strong>ICMP</strong> messages <strong>echo request</strong> and 
<strong>echo reply</strong>.
