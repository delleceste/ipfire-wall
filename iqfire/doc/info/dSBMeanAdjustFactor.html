<h3>Tune the excursion of the firewall activity indicators</h3>

<div id="content">

<h4>Activity representation in the <em>system tray icon</em>.</h4>

<p>
The activity of the firewall represented in the system tray icon works as follows.
<br/>
Each time the <em>system tray icon</em> is refreshed:
<ul>
<li>the number of packets processed in the period elapsed after the last refresh took place;</li>
<li>the mean of the packets processed in each period is calculated.</li>
</ul>

At this point, the number of packets received in the latest period is compared with the mean, and 
the indicator is drawn with a magnitude proportional to this comparison.


</p>

<h4>Tuning the mean adjust factor.</h4>
<p>
  Given the principle of functioning described above, one can easily understand that 
  in the majority of the cases, in which slots of time with low load alternate with 
  slots with much traffic, the indicator would vary between 0% and 100%, being 0
  when the flow is low (much lower than the mean), and 100% when higher than the mean.
</p>

<p>
  Adjusting this factor with a value between 2 and 4 will help to obtain a distribution 
  of the values of the indicators more significant and smooth.
</p>
<p>
  Try to vary this factor as you like and see immediately (without need to click on the <strong>Apply</strong> 
  button on the bottom of this window) the effects on the indicators.
