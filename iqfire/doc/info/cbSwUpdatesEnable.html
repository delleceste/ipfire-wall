<h3>Notify software updates</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

<em>iqfire-wall</em> is provided by a system that periodically can check
 on the <em>Internet</em> if software updates are available. It checks 
 for changes in the <strong>release version</strong>, that is, for instance, 
 from version 0.98.8 to 0.98.9 or from 0.99.9 to 1.0.

</p>

<p>
	It is recommended that you enable this feature, because with
	 every new release many bugs are fixed and often there are 
	 new features or enhancements.
</p>

<p>
	Also remember that, if you want to be sure to have the 
	<strong>most up to date</strong> software snapshot, you might 
	like to download the <em>source code</em> from the <strong>CVS</strong> 
	repository of <em>ipfire-wall</em>.
	Check the online documentation at <a href="http://www.giacomos.it/iqfire/download.html" title="http://www.giacomos.it/iqfire/download.html">iqfire-wall download page</a> 
	and visit the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipfire-wall" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipfire-wall">sourceforge.net ipfire-wall project page</a>, where you will find more information about using CVS.
