<h3>Contributing to software improvements and documentation</h3>

<h4 id="post">Post messages in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipfire-wall">sourceforge.net ipfire-wall project</a> forums</h4>

<p>
    If you want to help other people using the software, check periodically on the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipfire-wall">sourceforge.net ipfire-wall project</a> forums to look for messages 
    by people asking help about iqfire-wall installation or usage, and <em>post an answer</em>.
	Follow the instructions <a href="help.html#forum">in the Getting Help page</a> if you want to visit and post on the forums.
</p>

<h4 id="helpInfo">Improve <strong>interactive help and info</strong> system</h4>

<p>
    <strong>IQFIRE-wall</strong> embeds in its widgets an information and help system which is made up of a series of
    <em>html</em> files that are read and displayed on special widgets on a panel on the right of the main window.
    Those files reside by default in the installation directories of the software, which are <br/><br/>
    <cite>/usr/share/iqfire/doc/info/</cite><br/>
     <cite>/usr/share/iqfire/doc/help/</cite> and <br/> 
     <cite>/usr/share/iqfire/doc/manual/</cite><br/><br/>
    respectively for the <em>informational</em> widget, the <em>help</em> widget and the <em>manual</em> window.
  
</p>	

<p>
  Anyone can modify and improve the information contained in those <em>html</em> pages. <br/>
  Moreover, at the moment of the publication of these documentation web pages, and the publication of 
  <em>iqfire-wall</em>, many of the widgets making part of the software lack of the corresponding <em>html</em> 
  <em>help and info pages</em>.
</p>

<p>
  For this, anyone is welcome to update and improve the contents of the existing help files and to edit new ones 
  for the widgets without an associated <em>html</em> page.<br/>
  Using <strong>iqfire-wall</strong>, you will soon figure out what are the elements of the user interface which do
  not have a help associated: the <em>info and help</em> widgets print a message like <br/>
  <cite>This info document still has to be edited.</cite><br/>
  when the corresponding <em>html</em> pages are not complete.
</p>

<h4 id="manual">Improve <strong>the embedded manual</strong> system</h4>

<p>
  Just as the  <strong>interactive help and info</strong> system, also the <strong>manual</strong> embedded in 
  iqfire-wall will need some more pages to reach a good level of completeness...
</p>

<h4 id="submitting">Submit new material to the iqfire-wall application</h4>
<p>
  If you like to propose your improvements to one of the above mentioned parts of the software, or, generally, 
  to the whole software, please post a message on the  
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipfire-wall">sourceforge.net ipfire-wall project</a>
