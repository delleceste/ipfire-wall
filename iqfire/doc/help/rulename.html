<h3>Rule name</h3>
<p>
The rule name briefly describes your firewall rule.<br/>
You can type a name made up of any type of character, and long
at most 50 characters.
Note that not all the characters are allowed, so if you notice that
you cannot type a character inside the line edit, do not worry: it
is one of those not allowed!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hint</strong>:<br/>
Associating a good and significant name to a rule is useful to identify and recognize the rule itself without having to look at all its fields.
