<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>

This window displays all the rules loaded into the firewall. 
They are organized in a tree with the aim of being grouped 
by owner, policy and direction, for faster browsing.<br/>
If you are not the administrator of the machine (<cite>root</cite>), 
you can browse the <strong>Admin</strong> tree, but in read-only mode.
Actually, root can setup a group of rules which are always loaded into
the firewall and cannot be deleted or modified by an unprivileged user.
<br/>
The <strong>user</strong> tree instead can be browsed and modified.<br/>
<strong>Moving</strong> the mouse over each item in the tree, in the 
<strong>information</strong> panel above (if not active, click on the
<strong>i</strong> icon in the tool bar) one can see the rule represented
in a more readable <strong>html</strong> format, which summarizes the rule
represented in the tree item.

</p>

<p> 
<strong>Selecting</strong> a tree item will fix the information for that
rule, and moving the mouse over other items will no more produce an update 
in the info panel.

</p>

<p>
	Once an item is selected, right click on it if you want to:
	<ul>
	<li>add a new rule <strong>after</strong> the rule you're positioned on;</li>
	<li>modify the selected rule;</li>
	<li>delete the selected rule in the tree.</li>
	</ul>
	
	Remember to click on the <strong>Apply</strong> button to really 
	update the rules in the firewall and then on the <strong>Save</strong>
	 button, if you want to write the informations on the files.</br>
	If you are unhappy with your changes, just avoid applying or saving the 
	rules and go back to another firewall window or click on the <strong>Undo</strong>
	button.
</p>

<p>
	Inside the <cite>rule tree window</cite>, you can perform a <strong>search</strong> 
	based on strings accepting wildcards (<strong>*</strong>), clicking on the menu
	<strong>View</strong> and then <strong>Search...</strong>.<br/>
	A suitable widget will appear on the top of the tree and will perform a search for
	you.<br/>
	Just type the string you want to look for, e.g. <strong>192.168.1.*</strong>, select
	in the combo box the field inside which you want to look for (in this case 
	<strong>Source IP</strong>, and click on the button <strong>Find</strong>.
