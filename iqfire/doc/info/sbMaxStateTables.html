<h3>Maximum number of state tables</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

For each new connection tracked by the state machine, an associated <em>state table</em> is 
created inside the kernel.
<br/> This has been done to prevent <em>denial of service attacks</em>, that would create a 
huge amount of state tables entries that would saturate the system memory.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that, if you make large use of stateful rules, which actually is 
	encouraged, the firewall will allow at most this number of connections at a time.
	If a new connection is requested and the number of state entries has reached the 
	maximum allowed, <em>the new connection will be dropped</em>.
	<br/>So it is important to <strong>tune this number to the amount of traffic 
	expected in your network</strong> keeping it a bit higher than the maximum 
	peak possible in your computer network. A first period of observation could be a 
	good choice to finally tune this number to the optimum.
