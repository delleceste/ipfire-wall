<h3>A circular gauge as firewall activity indicator</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

The circular gauge presents two needles: one is green and the other is red.
The needles are <em>arrow</em> terminated: the red one represents the number of 
packets filtered and blocked per time unit, the green one the filtered and accepted 
packets.

</p>
<p>
  The system tray icon works like and analogue dashboard, configurable through the other
available paramters: <strong>Show needle arrows</strong>, <strong>Mean Adjust Factor</strong>, 
<strong>Relative length of the Accept Needle</strong> and <strong>Relative length of the Block Needle</strong>, 
</p>

<p>
  The level of the needles is proportional to the number of packets processed 
 in a certain amount of time compared with the mean of the number of packets 
 processed during all the firewall activity.
