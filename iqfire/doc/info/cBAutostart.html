<h3>Start iqfire-wall with Gnome or KDE!</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

The desktop managers <em>Gnome</em> and <em>KDE</em>, at startup, 
look inside a particular folder for special files called 
<cite>desktop files</cite>. Such kind of files are application 
launchers and, if placed in that special folder, are run at 
startup.

</p>

<p>
	<em>iqfire-wall</em> writes an entry in the folders used 
	by <em>Gnome</em> and <em>KDE</em> for <em>autostarting</em>
	programs, and so this feature should be available with the 
	mentioned desktop environments, together with those managers 
	that follow the <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org" title="freedesktop.org">
	freedesktop.org</a> specifications.
