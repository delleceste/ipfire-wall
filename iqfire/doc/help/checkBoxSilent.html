<h3>Silent modality</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Check this box to stop the communication between the kernel and userspace console.
If this feature is enabled, the firewall console will stop printing the packets being filtered
 by the firewall, although the firewall still is operating in the kernel.

</p>

<p>
	Put the console in the silent modality if you notice that your cpu is stressed by the 
	firewall console. This might happen in very heavy network loads or with very old machines.
