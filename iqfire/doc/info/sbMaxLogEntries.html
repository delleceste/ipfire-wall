<h3>Maximum number of log entries</h3>

<div id="content">


<p>

As it happens with the NAT and <em>state</em> tables, when the <em>log level between user and
 kernel</em> is set to <strong>Smart Log: only unseen packets</strong>, for each information 
entry sent to the <em>firewall console</em> to notify a filtering or Nat action 
 a table is created and memorized, so that <em>the same information</em>
	 is not sent again to the user for a certain period of time.

</p>

<p>
	The number of maximum <cite>log entries</cite> is tunable here. When it is reached, 
	no more packets are notified to userspace and you might experience a silence period 
	in the firewall console, until another entry decays and is removed from the internal 
	list.
