<h3>Maximum number of NAT tables in the kernel</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

When a packet is subjected to <em>Network address (and/or port) translation</em>, an associated 
<em>NAT table</em> is created inside the <em>ipfire-wall</em> kernel, to track the connection 
and apply the NAT to all the other packets pertaining to the same connection flow.

</p>


<p>

It is possible to tune the <strong>maximum number</strong> of <em>NAT table entries</em>, so that 
their numerousness does not grow over that limit. This was done thinking about a possible <em>
denial of service</em> attack, in which an attacker could fill up the kernel memory with  
useless NAT tables.

</p>

<p>
	Tune this value to the estimated amount of NAT traffic you expect for your linux 
	NAT/firewall, keeping in mind that when the limit is reached <strong>NAT stops 
	being applied</strong> until the timer of some other entry in the NAT table list 
	expires and frees the associated memory.
</p>

<h3>Lifetime of NAT entries</h3>
<p>
	The lifetime of <em>NAT</em> entries depends on the <em>state of the connection</em> and 
	so it is managed internally by the kernel.
	On the <em>command line interface</em> <strong>ipfire</strong>, it is possible to list 
	the kernel NAT tables by pressing the keys <strong>F4</strong> to view the 
	 <strong>source NAT</strong> entries and <strong>F6</strong> to observe the 
	<strong>destination NAT</strong> entries. At the moment, this is considered an 
	advanced feature and so it is not included in the <em>iqfire</em> graphical
	 user interface.
