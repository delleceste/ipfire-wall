<h3>Network Address Translation</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

This option enables <em>Network Address Translation</em> globally.
<em>Network Address Translation</em> (<strong>NAT</strong>) is a feature that 
allows changing the source or destination address (or source or destination port)
of a packet to redirect it to another destination (or service, for port translation) or 
to make it appear as coming from another host (for source NAT).

</p>

<p>
	For instance, with Network Address Translation you are able to redirect 
	all the traffic from host A to host B towards host C.
	Moreover, it is possible to redirect a connection to port x towards another 
	port number.
</p>

<p>
	A particular case of <em>NAT</em> is represented by <strong>masquerade</strong>: 
	used particularly in gateways, it allows to <strong>share an internet connection</strong> 
	among multiple hosts referring to the gateway connected to the <em>Internet</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Configuring <em>NAT</em> requires <em>administrator</em> privileges: this means that 
	only root can add/remove NAT rules and enable/disable this option.
</p>

<p>
	To read further on about the NAT theme, here some links to external pages are 
	provided. Most of them are quite technical:
