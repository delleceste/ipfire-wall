<h3>Rules</h3>

<p>

This window displays all the rules loaded into the firewall. 
They are organized in a tree with the aim of being grouped 
by owner, policy and direction, for faster browsing.<br/>

There you can usually see <strong>two</strong> main trees 
(unless you are <cite>the root user</cite>, and in that case you
will see only one):

<ul>
	<li>the administrator's rule tree, and</li>
	<li>your rule tree.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Move</strong> or <strong>select</strong> a rule in the tree 
to have a representation on this <strong>info</strong> panel.
