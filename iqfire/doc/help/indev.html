<h3>Input network device</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
Click on the arrow in the <em>combo box</em> to view a list of available 
<em>network devices</em>.
</p>
<p>
The network devices with a <cite>plugged</cite> network patch are the devices really 
up and running, while those <cite>unplugged</cite> are not up at the moment, but they 
were probably <em>manually</em> added in the past by the user.


</p>
<p>
	If the device you intend to specify is not in the list, you can type 
	its name and add it, if you know that the interface will come up at a 
	certain moment and you want to apply the rule to that interface.<br/>
	This is for instance the case of the <em>dynamic <strong>ppp</strong></em> 
	connections through a <em>modem</em>, which become available after 
	dialing the <em>Internet Service Provider</em> phone number.
</p>
<p>
	The <em>point to point</em> internet connections, such as those provided by 
	a classical <em>Internet Service Provider</em> via a traditional <em>56k or DSL</em> 
	modem, are usually named <cite>ppp</cite> and so probably the dynamic network 
	interface created by the linux kernel is something named like <strong>ppp0</strong>, 
	or <strong>ppp1</strong>, if you have more than one of such connections.
</p>

<p>
	<em>IP tunnels</em> usually create interfaces named like <cite>tun0</cite> or 
		<cite>tunX</cite>, where X is a number.
