<h3>Output blocked packets</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
	The <strong>output blocked packets over total packets processed</strong> curve
	 represents the percentage of the <strong>output</strong> packets
	 blocked through the firewall over the <strong>total</strong> packets
	 processed.
	<br/>
	 This curve is represented in red and its line is continuous.


</p>

<p>
	Move your mouse over the graph to watch the curve details
	(date and percentage).
</p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>
	The time domain is divided into small periods and the statistics
	are calculated over each period.
	If you view the plot as <strong>steps</strong>, then each step
	represents the percentage of packets blocked/dropped <strong>y axis</strong> over the 
	time slot represented by the step width in the <strong>time axis</strong>.
