<h3>Elements in the authorization popup</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

The popup that asks for authorization when a packet does not 
match any rule in the policies can notify at most a certain number 
of elements. This helps you manage the items in the popup without getting
 lost among many entries.

</p>

<p>
	Have a look also at the other options in this section to fine tune the 
	popup <cite>Authorize/deny new connections></cite>.
