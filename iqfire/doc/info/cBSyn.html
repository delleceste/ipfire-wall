<h3>The TCP <em>SYN</em>chronization flag</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

The tcp <em>SYN</em> flag is used to <strong>initialize a connection</strong>.
<br/>
If it is the only flag set to true, the packet represents the <em>first</em> 
packet in a connection, i.e. a <em>connection request</em>.
<br/>
If instead it is set to true <em>together with the ack</em> flag, it represents 
a <em>connection accepted</em> packet, in response to a previous <em>connection request</em>.

</p>
<p>
	For example, if you require a web page with your browser, an outgoing 
	 <em>connection request</em> is sent and an incoming <em>connection accepted</em> 
	 response packet is expected.
</p>

<h3>Observation</h3>

<p>
	Enabling the <strong>syn</strong> check here and choosing <strong>On</strong> in the 
		radio button nearby is a good idea to <em>allow a <cite>well initiated</cite> 
		tcp connection</em>.
	Actually, all TCP connections should start with the syn flag on and all other flags off. 
	Imposing this on your rule should guarantee that the connection is initiated 
	cleanly.
	<br/>To check against all this flags, you should enable all the other check boxes 
	and select <strong>off</strong> for all the other flags except <strong>syn</strong>.
	<br/>
	Moreover, this advanced packet filtering based on the verification of the 
	<strong>syn</strong> tcp flag <em>requires a stateful rule</em> to work correctly after 
	the connection has been setup.<br/>
	Actually, if the first packet is accepted thanks to the <em>syn</em> flag set to 
	true, it is necessary to associate a <em>state table</em> to the new connection to 
	guarantee the data transmission in both directions.
