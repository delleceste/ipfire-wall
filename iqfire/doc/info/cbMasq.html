<h3>Masquerade</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Masquerading a connection means changing the source address of a packet 
to let it appear as coming from a source different from the real address.
With this kind of <em>source nat</em> it is possible, for multiple hosts in 
a private <em>local area network</em>, to connect to the external <em>Internet</em>
 through a <em>gateway</em>. <br/>
The <em>gateway</em> must be configured to <em>masquerade</em> the connections passing 
through the <em>network interface connected to the Internet</em>. In this way, all the 
packets originating from the internal network, with private addresses, are <em>masqueraded</em> 
when passing through the <em>masquerade firewall/gateway</em> and can connect to the 
external world, since they appear as if they were sent from the gateway, not from a 
private addressed machine.

</p>

<p>
	As to the internal implementation, a masqueraded connection requires an 
	<em>associated table</em> to remember the firewall that an <em>outgoing 
	masqueraded packet</em> must be <em><strong>de</strong>masqueraded</em>
	when coming back from the external world.

	To read further on about <em>masquerade</em>, here you can find a link to an
	 external page. <cite>Masquerade</cite> is a terminology introduced with linux to describe 
	a particular kind of <em>source nat</em>, and is implemented inside the linux kernel.
