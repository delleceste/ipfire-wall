<h3>Statistics</h3>

<a  href="imgs/uncompressed/stats.jpg"><img src="imgs/stats.jpg" alt="Rule adder, page tcp flags"/></a>

<p>

The <strong>statistics</strong> window represents with great detail the
activity of the <cite>firewall</cite> over time.
</p>

<p>
Two visualizations are available:

<ul>
<li>A plot representing the percentage of packets <strong>blocked</strong> or
 <strong>allowed</strong> for each direction <strong>over time</strong> </li>
 
 <li>
 	An <strong>html</strong> formatted page, which sums up the statistics
 	in a numeric form.
 </li>
 
</ul>

</p>

<p>

In this window one can see the plot of the statistics with 
<strong>percentage</strong> in the <strong>y</strong> axis and the 
<strong>time</strong> in the <strong>x</strong> axis. 
</p>
<p>
	The percentage is referred to the total packets processed and it is
	based on requests forwarded to the <strong>firewall</strong> in the 
	kernel space.
	The time axis starts from the moment the interface is started up.
	
</p>

<p>
	Another view is possible: click on the <strong>radio button</strong>
	called <strong>Summary</strong> to view an <strong>html</strong> formatted
	 text with a summary of the statistics concerning the <cite>firewall</cite>
	  activity.
</p>

<h5>Zooming the plot</h5>


<p>

At any point inside the plot, you can click the <strong>left</strong> button of
the mouse and hold it pressed while drawing a <strong>rectangle</strong> over
 the portion of the graph you want to <strong>zoom</strong>. <br/>
 When you <strong>release</strong> the mouse, the <strong>rectangular area</strong>
  you selected will be zoomed.

</p>

<h5>Unzooming the plot</h5>


<p>
	Simply <strong>click</strong> with the <strong>middle</strong> mouse button
	at any place in the plot to zoom back of one level.
	If you did zoom <cite>3</cite> times for instance, you will have to click 
	<cite>3</cite> times to go back to the normal zoom (<strong>1:1</strong>).
</p>

<h5>Showing and hiding curves in the plot</h5>


<p>
	In the <strong>Plot</strong> mode of the statistics window, one can
	notice, in the lowest part of the widget, a series of buttons, each
	representing a particular curve on the plot.<br/>
	<strong>Moving</strong> the mouse over those buttons will produce 
	this help message to change and describe the meaning of the curve 
	associated with the button.
	<strong>Move away</strong> the mouse from the button to view again the 
	global statistics window message.
	
</p>

<p>
	Another easy way to get information about the curve represented by the 
	button is to stop the mouse cursor over it and wait shortly for a 
	<strong>tool tip</strong> describing the plot item.
	This is useful if in the future you do not want to have the <strong>help panel
	</strong> shown in this window.
</p>


</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p>
	<strong class="note">Note</strong> that, while the plot starts gathering the information
	at the moment of the startup of the <strong>iqFirewall</strong> user interface, 
	the <strong>textual</strong> page tracks the behaviour of the firewall since the
	<cite>kernel module</cite> of <strong>ipfire-wall</strong> is loaded. This typically
	 means at computer startup.
</p>

<p>
	Beware of the different information that may contain the plot and the textual summary then!
