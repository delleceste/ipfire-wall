<p>
	<strong>iqFirewall</strong> is a simple graphical user interface which
	helps you protect your personal computer from the outside internet world,
	while providing amusing tools to configure the rules of the firewall and
	to observe the statistics of the network traffic filtering.
</p>

<p>	
	This page provides access to the main functionalities of the firewall,
	as well as its <cite>online</cite> manual.<br/>
	<strong>iqFirewall</strong> consists of a set of tools to configure and 
	and control the firewall actions. Some of them are:
</p>	
	<ul>
		<li>A monitoring <a href="action://showConsole">console</a>, 
			showing the traffic being processed, in full analogy with
			the former <strong>ipfirewall</strong>;</li>
		<li>
			a <a href="action://showRuleTree">rule tree</a>
 			window, representing the characteristics and the order
			of the rules being applied by the firewall. There you can
			edit and add or remove your personal rules, also if you are
			not the system administrator! For instance, currently 
			<strong class="accept">$accRulesNum$</strong> permission rules are loaded 
			and <strong class="blocked">$denRulesNum$</strong> 
			denial ones;
		</li>
		
		<li>
			a <a href="action://showStats">statistics</a>
 			window, showing the percentage of the blocked/accepted
			packets over time! Until now, <cite class="accept">$allowed$</cite> network
			packets nave been allowed, while <cite class="blocked">
				$blocked$</cite> blocked.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			An innovative <a href="action://showRuleView">linux routing block scheme</a> 
 			window, allowing the user to add new rules and to observe 
 			<cite>per direction</cite> statistics.
		</li>

	</ul>
	
<p>

	navigate through the menus and the tool bar to discover other aspects of this 
	<cite>Linux firewall</cite>, such as the right navigation panel or the information
