<h3>Log level between user and kernel spaces</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

This box tunes the level of information that is exchanged between the user and the kernel
 space, concerning the <em>firewall console</em>.
The <strong>recommended</strong> choice is <strong>Smart Log: only unseen packets</strong>, 
because it avoids repeating the identical information many times.

</p>

<p>
	Tune consequently the <strong>Time to live of an information entry</strong>, in the 
	box above, that establishes the amount of time after which an identical item is 
	shown again on the firewall console.
</p>

<p>
	The issues related to this settings are discussed in 
	<a href="http://www.giacomos.it/ipfire/logging.html">this ipfire-wall web page</a>.
