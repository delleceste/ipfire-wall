<h3>Pending packets</h3>

<p>

Here <cite>iqFirewall</cite> lists all the packets arrived at your <cite>linux</cite>
 box which did not match a rule.
 Normally, when this event happens, a <strong>popup message</strong> should appear
  in the proximity of the <strong>system tray icon</strong> in your desktop panel. See also the
  <strong>note</strong> below...
  
</p>

<p>
	Here you have a list of options for this window:
 
<ul>
	<li>Double click on a column of any item and change its contents if you like, or</li>
	<li>right click on a column to get a popup with some default values for the 
	 content of that column; </li>
	<li>click on one of the buttons below to add the rule to the <strong>blocked</strong>
	 list, to the <strong>permission</strong> list or simply to remove the item from the list.</li>
</ul>


</p>

<p>

	The fields represented in the columns of this window have the same meaning 
	that they assume in the <strong>rules tree</strong> window, to which we send the 
	reader back.

        right click on the <strong>system tray icon</strong> and choose
	<strong>popups...</strong> and tick <strong>Unknown Connections</strong>.
