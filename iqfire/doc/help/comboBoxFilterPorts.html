<h3>Filter on the  port</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Click on the combo box and choose among the options:

<ul>
	<li>not to filter the packet on the  port (<strong>ANY</strong>).
	This means that the filter rule will not consider at all the 
	port number;</li>
	<li>filter on the basis of the  port, be it source or destination: with this 
	option it is enough that the port provided matches any between the <em>source
 	port or the destination port</em>(<strong>SOURCE OR
		DESTINATION</strong>);</li>
 	<li>filter on the basis of the <strong>source</strong> port
		(<strong>SOURCE</strong>);</li>
 	<li>filter on the basis of the <strong>destination</strong> port
	(<strong>DESTINATION</strong>);</li>
 	<li>filter on the basis of <strong>both</strong> 
	the <strong>destination</strong> port <strong>and</strong> source 
	port (<strong>SOURCE AND
		DESTINATION</strong>). In this case, two line edits
 		will appear on the right 
	of this combo box to let you fill in the two ports you want to filter on.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
	Remember that you will have to provide a complete and correct 
	 port, which is an integer number from 0 to 65535.
	Partial matches are not allowed because
	 the filtering is done on the numeric port, not on its string representation.
	 This means that a filter defined as <strong>SOURCE</strong>, <strong>60</strong> 
	 will match a packet with the source port equal to 60, but will not match 
	 a packet with a source port set to 6000 or 601.
