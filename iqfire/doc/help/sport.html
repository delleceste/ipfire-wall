<h3>Source port</h3>

<div id="content">
<p>
	You can type here the <strong>source port</strong>.
	<br/>
	A port identifies a <strong>service</strong> in a host and is an
	<strong>integer</strong> positive number less than <strong>65535</strong>.
	
	The firewall widgets will help you typing your desired port number avoiding
	mistakes in the syntax.
	For example, you will not be able to type any character which is not a 
	number, nor will you be able to write a 
	decimal number not in the range 1-65535.



</p>

<p>
	Once you have setup a rule and you have applied it, you can
	explore the <strong>tree</strong> widget below this dialog
	window and see on the <a href="action://showinfopanel">information</a> 
	panel a summary of each rule.
	Moving over a summary, you can click on addresses and port to resolve them
	into their <strong>names</strong>, where this is possible.
