<h3>Create a denial rule from the selected item(s)</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

It is possible to add the selected items in the list of the <em>denial</em> rules.
The items will be removed from this list and for each of them a new rule will
 be added to the denial <a href="action://showruletree">rule tree</a>.

</p>
<p>
Before adding a rule <cite>inspired</cite> to the item, you can double click 
on each column if you like to change some values, like for example to transform an IP address into 
an interval, or add a netmask, or set to <cite>any</cite> some fields you are not interested in.
</p>

<p>
	To set to <em>any</em> some field, just right click over the corresponding column 
	and a <em>popup menu</em> will help you do the task.
