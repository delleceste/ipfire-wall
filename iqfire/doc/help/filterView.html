<h3>Filter view</h3>

<p>

Move your mouse over the elements of this widget to get 
specific help. 
Once you have setup the desired fields, click on the 
check box <cite>Apply the filter view</cite> and go back
to the console window (<strong>Menu -> Window -> Console</strong>) 
or click on the <strong>Back</strong> arrow in the tool bar.
</p>

<h3>Important note</h3>

<p>
The settings in this window <strong>do not affect the firewall packet filter or NAT activity</strong>.<br/>
They only make a selection of which packets to show or not in the <strong>console</strong>, to allow the 
user to concentrate only in a subset of all the packets processed.
</p>

<p>
	For instance, i could be interested in watching on the console only the TCP packets, or only the 
	packets initiating successfully a connection.
