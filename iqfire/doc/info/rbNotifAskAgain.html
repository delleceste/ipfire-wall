<h3>Completely ignore the notification</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

  If you choose this option, then all the selected items will be 
  completely forgotten by the firewall, and it will ask you again 
  when it processes another packet equal to the selected.

</p>

<p>
  Note that closing the popup by the <em>x</em> button of the popup 
window is equivalent to completely ignore all the packets notified.
</p>

<h3>Color</h3>
<p>
  The items selected and marked as <strong>Ask again</strong> will be 
  bold represented and will assume a <strong>gray</strong> color.
