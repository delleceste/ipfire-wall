<h3>Resolve IP addresses and port numbers</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

This option offers the possibility to display on the popup that 
notifies a rule being applied to a connection the <strong>name 
representation</strong> of the IP addresses and ports.

</p>

<p>
	Actually, IP addresses and ports are numbers, but this option 
	for each of them starts a sub process that tries to resolve 
	the numbers into names.
</p>

<p>
	For instance, the port number <em>22</em> is associated to the <em>ssh</em> service, 
	and the IP address <em>62.149.140.40</em> to the name <cite>www.giacomos.it</cite>.
