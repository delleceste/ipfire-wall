<h3>Set the max table entries</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

For each <em>Network address translation</em> applied to a packet, the kernel
 uses a dynamic table to remember the data associated to the <em>Nat</em> operation 
on that packet. 

</p>

<p>
Click on the arrows in the <em>spinbox</em> to change the value of the maximum
 number of NAT tables that you want to allow in the kernel internal tables. 


</p>

<p>
	Remember that, when the number of the NAT tables reaches the maximum allowed, 
	<strong>NAT will stop working until one or more among the allocated entries 
	expires</strong> and the memory associated is freed.
</p>

<p>
	At the moment, the event mentioned above is logged through the <em>system logger</em> 
	only.
</p>

<p>
	Tune the number according to the amount of NAT traffic you expect in your network.
