<h3>Filter on the IP address</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Click on the combo box and choose among the options:

<ul>
	<li>not to filter the packet on the IP address (<strong>ANY</strong>).
	This means that the filter rule will not consider at all the internet
	address;</li>
	<li>filter on the basis of the internet address, be it source or destination: with this 
	option it is enough that the address provided matches any between the <em>source
 	address or the destination address</em>(<strong>SOURCE OR
		DESTINATION</strong>);</li>
 	<li>filter on the basis of the <strong>source</strong> network address
		(<strong>SOURCE</strong>);</li>
 	<li>filter on the basis of the <strong>destination</strong> address
	(<strong>DESTINATION</strong>);</li>
 	<li>filter on the basis of <strong>both</strong> 
	the <strong>destination</strong> address <strong>and</strong> source 
	address (<strong>SOURCE AND
		DESTINATION</strong>). In this case, two boxes will appear on the right 
	of this combo box to let you fill in the two addresses you want to filter on.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
	Remember that you will have to provide a complete and correct 
	IP address, in the form <strong>x.y.w.z</strong>, where x, y, w and 
	z are integers between 0 and 255 (IPv4 address syntax).
	Partial matches (e.g. 192.168.0 or 192.168.1.) are not allowed because
	 the filtering is done on the numeric address, not on its string representation.
