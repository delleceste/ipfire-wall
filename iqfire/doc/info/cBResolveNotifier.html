<h3>Resolve IP addresses and ports in the popup items</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

A new item in the popup displays the following information:
<ul>
	<li>packet direction (<strong>input and output supported</strong>);</li>
	<li>protocol;</li>
	<li>source and destination IP addresses;</li>
	<li>source and destination port numbers;</li>
	<li>name of the network interface through which the packet passed;</li>
	<li>suggested rule name;</li>
	<li>possibility to notify when a network packet matches the item.</li>
</ul>
	
</p>

<p>
	The IP addresses and ports are numbers, but if you enable their resolution,
	 then they will be shown with their associated names together with the
	numeric form.
</p>

<p>
	The address and port names are available as <strong>tooltips</strong> when the 
	mouse stops over an item of the <em>popup</em>, or in this <em>informational panel</em>,
	always when the mouse moves over the items or selects one of them.
