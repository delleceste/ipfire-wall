<h3>Log based on the connection state</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

This option provides yet less information to the console: not only 
identical packets aren't sent through the user/kernel communication 
channel, but only packets <em>with different states</em> are shown.

</p>

<p>
	This means you will see for a connection
 	only a packet notification per state: setup, setup ok, 
 	established, fin wait, time wait, close wait.. and so on.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the same information is presented <em>again</em> after 
the <strong>log timeout</strong> has elapsed.
To tune such timeout, you must be <strong>root</strong> and change 
the settings in the <a href="action://showconfigurationwidget" 
title="Go to the configuration widget">Configuration page</a>, section 
<strong>Advanced</strong>.
