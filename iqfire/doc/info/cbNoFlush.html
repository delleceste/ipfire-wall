<h3>Do not unload the rules at exit</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Root might want to start iqfire-wall to edit the administrative ruleset 
and then close the <em>root configuration session</em> (i.e. close iqfirewall) 
and let normal users use the software, while leaving all the rules loaded into 
the kernel. <br/>
On the other hand, <strong>normal users' rules are always flushed from the 
firewall when the application is closed</strong>, and there is no way to 
change this behaviour.

</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, if this feature is disabled, when the user interface is turned off
	all the rules are removed and this means:
	<ul>
	<li>no rules are loaded: the default policy (normally <strong>block</strong>) is applied;</li>
	<li>every normal user can add his own rules (if allowed in the check box above) and they will be
		the only rules consulted. </li> 
	</ul>
</p>
