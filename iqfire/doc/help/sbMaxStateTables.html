<h3>Maximum number of state tables</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Click on the arrows or type a number to represent the maximum number of 
state tables that the kernel is allowed to create before dropping any 
new connection request.

</p>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
	When the number of state entries (i.e. the connections allowed 
	by a <em>stateful rule</em>) reaches this number, no more stateful 
	connections will be allowed, and you might experience that no new 
	communications can be created until one or more <em>NAT entries</em> 
	timeout and are deleted from the kernel list.
</p>

<h3>Loopback rules and stateful rules</h3>
<p>
	Keeping the <em>loopback</em> rules (for packets generated <em>and</em> destinated 
	to the <em>local host</em>) <strong>stateless</strong>, as in the <em>default 
	configuration of the policies</em> (the one loaded when you first installed 
	iqfire-wall) is strongly recommended, because in most cases you always want to 
	allow the traffic between applications running on the local host.
</p>
<p>
	Many graphical interfaces require the loopback communication and so keep the 
	related rules off the state machine, so that in case it saturates as described 
	above, the local communication between the applications running on your host 
	are not affected.
