<h3>Allow an unprivileged user to insert his rules</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Check this box if you want to allow a normal user to insert his own rules.
Remember that his rules will have a <em>lower priority</em> with respect to 
administrator's, i.e. will be applied <strong>after administrator's</strong>.
Moreover, the root rules cannot be modified or deleted by a normal user.

</p>

<p>
This is a special feature of <em>iqfire-wall</em> and it is usually safe to enable 
it, of course the administrator having safely configured the firewall first.
