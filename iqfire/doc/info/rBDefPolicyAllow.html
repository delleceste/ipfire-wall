<h3>Default policy: allow</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Each packet inspected by the firewall is examined in search of a <em>permission or denial</strong> 
rule  matching its fields (ip addresses, ports, protocol..).
<br/>
If a match is found, the verdict corresponding to the rule is applied, otherwise the 
<em>default verdict must be applied</em>.

</p>

<p>
	Here you can decide which default policy is to be applied to the packets that do not
 		match any rule in the firewall: <em>block</em> or <em>accept</em>.
</p>

<p>
	The suggested default policy is to <strong>deny</strong> all the packets that 
	do not match an <strong>explicit rule</strong>. This setting represent also 
	a good starting point to <em>safely configure</em> the firewall: at the beginning 
	all the traffic is blocked and little by little you allow the connections you want 
	to.
</p>
<p>
	The <strong>popup that notifies the packets not matching any rule</strong>, 
	available right clicking on the <em>system tray icon</em> and choosing<br/> 
	<strong>Popups...->Unknown Connections</strong><br/>, can help speeding up the 
	selection of the desired and undesired connections through the firewall.
</p>

<p>
	This configuration operates on the <strong>/proc</strong> entry 
	<br/><cite>/proc/IPFIRE/policy</cite>.

		title="Open the web page http://www.giacomos.it/ipfire/proc.html">/proc interface for reading and changing default firewall policy</a> 
	from the web documentation of <em>ipfire-wall</em> if you are interested in more 
	details.
