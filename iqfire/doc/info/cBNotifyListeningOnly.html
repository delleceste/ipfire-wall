<h3>Notify attempts to connect to active services only</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Your host usually has a set of services active and listening on a determined 
<em>service access point</em>, i.e. a particular <em>port number</em>.
Hackers are usually interested in addressing their attacks towards active services,
 such as a <strong>spyware</strong> and other malicious software that might be running 
on your machine and <em>listening</em> on a particular port number.

</p>

<p>
	For <strong>TCP</strong> connections, <em>iqfire-wall</em> is able to 
	recognize what services are actually listening on your machine and 
	warn you only when there is an attempt to connect to an <strong>active</strong> 
	one.
</p>

<p>
	On a host directly connected to the <em>Internet</em>, this option should reduce the 
	amount of warnings for packets without an associated filter rule to the essential ones: 
	those directed to the active services in your box.
