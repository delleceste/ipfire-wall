<h3>Refresh speed of the system tray icon</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

The system tray icon of <em>iqfire-wall</em> indicates the status of the firewall,
when the animation is enabled.

</p>
<p>
In particular, every <em>Refresh speed of the animation</em> <strong>milliseconds</strong>, 
two rectangles are drawn over the icon. One is green, and represents the <em>allowed</em> 
packets filtered in that time interval, and the other is red, representing the <em>blocked</em>
 packets. Each rectangle has the height <em>proportional to the number of filtered packets
 in the specified interval</em>.
</p>

<p>
	The user, observing the <em>system tray activity</em>, has an idea of the state 
	of the firewall at each instant.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, drawing very often over the icon requires a bit of cpu calculations and this 
	might not be efficient for older systems: tune the animation speed to obtain a good 
	compromise between a good looking animation and a good performance of your system.
</p>

<p>
	A good value for a recent system could be around 800 milliseconds, older systems might like 
	an interval of one second or more.
