<h3>iqFirewall presentation</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

	This is iq<strong>firewall hints</strong> section.<br/>
	In this corner you will find some useful help information
	about the contents of the firewall window currently displayed.
	<br/>
	The behaviour of this element is analogous to the one described
	for the info section.
	<ul>
	<li>You can hide/show the help section clicking on the <em>Sidebar
     		Contents</em> toolbar, on the <strong>yellow bulb</strong> icon;</li>
     	<li>moving your mouse over the window items will then provide
     		useful hints about the usage of each element, for instance,
		in a line edit used to configure an IP address, this 
		dynamic help will give you some advice on how the 
 		IP addresses have to be written.</li>
 	 
	<li><strong>NOTE</strong>: the <strong>help</strong> text is updated 
 	 with a <strong>delay</strong> of a few <strong>milliseconds</strong> 
 	 after the mouse enters a widget, to avoid continuous changes of the help contents  
 	 during the user mouse movements over a window. The delay is 
 	 tunable in the <a href="action://showconfigurationwidget">configuration window</a>, under the <strong>paths</strong> page.</li>
 	 	
 	<li><strong>Scroll the mouse</strong> over an item to scroll the contents
 	 of the <strong>help</strong> or the <strong>info</strong>
 	 text browsers!</li>
     	<li>Usually, bringing the mouse pointer outside the firewall 
     	 window and then moving it again on the main widget of the
     	 window itself, will display the generic help on the
     	 section currently shown (this short document is an example).</li>
     	 <li>The <strong>help</strong> and <strong>info</strong> sections
     	 can be <em>vertically resized</em> with the mouse by placing the 
     	 pointer at the boundary of the two sections (<em>splitter</em>).</li>
     	 <li>Also the horizontal space occupied by the
	  <strong>help</strong> and <strong>info panel</strong> can be
	  varied with the mouse, by means of a <em>vertical splitter</em>.</li>
     	
	<li>Click <a href="manual://manual.html">here</a> 
	to start reading the manual</li>
	
	<li>You can also open the <a href="action://showconsole">here</a>
		to see the firewall in action, or</li>
	
	<li>have a look at the <a href="action://showruletree">rules</a> loaded
	</li>
