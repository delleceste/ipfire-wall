<h3>Filter by direction</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Click on the combo box and select the direction of the packets you want to visualize on the console.


</p>

<p>
	For instance, if you choose the <strong>INPUT</strong> option, then you will see on the console
	only the packets directed to your host, although obviously the firewall still filters all the packets
 	going and coming through the network.
