<h3>The console</h3>

<p>

This is the <strong>iqFirewall</strong> console.
It is the <cite>kde</cite> <strong>konsole</strong>, which is loaded
at startup as a part of the graphical interface.
It shares the profile of your <cite>kde</cite> console (fonts,
colors, number of lines, and so on).
So, if you like to change such settings, open a <strong>konsole</strong>
from the menu <strong>K -> system -> konsole</strong> and change its settings.
Saving them as the global profile will result in having the <strong>iqFirewall</strong>
console consistent with your <cite>kde</cite> <strong>konsole</strong>.
