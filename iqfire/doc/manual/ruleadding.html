<h3>Managing Rules</h3>
<a  href="imgs/uncompressed/adder1.jpg"><img src="imgs/adder1.jpg" alt="Rule adder, page 1"/></a>
<p>
In the first page of the <strong>rule adding/modifying wizard</strong> you can setup
 the rule name, the network protocol and device of the rule.
</p>
<p>
Note that, in the lower part of the dialog, a summary of the rule being created/modified
is available. Just modify a field and watch the changes in the lower part.
In this way, when you configure the next steps, you can always keep in mind all the settings
 previously configured in the other phases.
</p>

<p>
In the second part, called <cite>Network Layer</cite> one can setup <strong>internet addresses</strong> 
which the rule shall match. As you can see, many options are choosable here.
In all the configuration widgets, the keyboard input is filtered so that the user is prevented from
 typing addresses with wrong syntax.
</p>

<p>
In the third page of the configuration widget, the transport protocol related part is configured.
This means <strong>port numbers</strong> for <strong>TCP</strong> and <strong>UDP</strong> protocols, as
 well as <strong>the TCP flags</strong> concerning the TCP control protocol (see the image below).
</p>

<p>
  Enable the flag you want to check and then choose if you want it to be <strong>on</strong> or <strong>off</strong> 
 to match your rule.
</p>
  
<p>
As you can see, the configuration of a new rule, or the modification of an already existing one, is very
 simple and straightforward interacting with this dialog.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Apply</strong> adds the rule on the <strong>rule tree</strong>, 
at the first available position <strong>after</strong> the item you selected in the adding action, while
<strong>Cancel</strong> interrupts and cancels the procedure.
With the buttons <strong>Previous</strong> and <strong>Next</strong>, you can navigate through the configuration
 pages of the adder dialog.


</p>

<p>
Note that while adding or modifying a rule, the main window is disabled and so you are required to 
complete or cancel the operation before being able to interact with the main window.

</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding, the <strong>help</strong> and <strong>info</strong> right panels are still available
 and updated during the operations on the adder dialog. So you can keep an eye on them if you need help!
If they are not visible, click on the corresponding <strong>toolbar</strong> icons to activate them.
