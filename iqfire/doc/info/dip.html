<h3>Destination IP address</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
The <strong>destination IP address</strong> identifies the 
<strong>receiver</strong> of a packet sent over the network.<br/>
An <strong>IP address</strong> is a unique identifier used by computers 
to communicate with each other on a <strong>computer network</strong>,
using the <strong>internet protocol (IP)</strong> standard.
Some addresses are intended to be unique in the whole <em>Internet</em>, 
other are unique in a more restricted context, such as a home or an
enterprise, or a university (<em>local or private addresses</em>).

</p>

<h4>Representation</h4>
<p>
	An <strong>IP address</strong> is represented by four decimal
 	numbers (<strong>octets</strong>) separated by a dot. Each decimal number ranges from
	<strong>0</strong> to <strong>255</strong>.<br/>
	Examples are <strong>192.168.0.1</strong> or <strong>147.131.40.11</strong>.
</p>

<h4>Classes of addresses</h4>
<p>
	All the possible <strong>IP addresses</strong> are grouped in 
	<strong>classes of networks</strong>:
	<ul>
	<li><strong>class A</strong>: the first octet ranges from 1 to 126;</li>
	<li><strong>class B</strong>: the first octet ranges from 128 to 191;</li>
	<li><strong>class C</strong>: the first octet ranges from 192 to 223;</li>
	<li>The class D is not currently used.</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>Special meanings of some addresses:
	<li>The <strong>special address starting from 127</strong> represents
         the local computer, independently from the real network, and it is 
	mainly used for testing purposes;</li>
	<li>The <strong>special addresses starting from 224</strong> are 
	reserved for particular uses, such as <strong>multicasting</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Machines which are not connected to the outside world need not to have 
globally unique IP addresses. The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">RFC 1918</a>
 defines the ranges of addresses for <strong>private networks</strong>.
 These addresses are never routed and belong to the following intervals:

<ul>
	<li><strong>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255</strong>, for class A;</li>
	<li><strong>172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255</strong>, for class B;</li>
	<li><strong>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255</strong>, for class C;</li>
</ul>

</p>
