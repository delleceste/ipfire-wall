<h3>The pre routing block</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
The packets coming from anywhere hit first of all the <strong>pre routing</strong> stage.
There the <em>routing decisions</em> are taken, and each packet is
inspected, particularly its <strong>destination IP address field</strong>.
On the basis of its destination, the packet is delivered <strong>locally</strong>,
to an application runnin on the machine (<strong>input block</strong>) or 
<strong>forwarded</strong> to another computer in the network, through the
<strong>forward</strong> block.
</p>
<p>
Since the most important aspect taken into account here is the <strong>destination</strong>
of a packet, here you are provided some tools to <strong>change the destination</strong> of the packet, both in terms of <strong>IP address</strong> and in terms or <strong>service</strong> (<strong>destination port</strong>).
<br/>
This means:
<ul>
<li>adding a <a href="action://adddnat">destination NAT rule</a>.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Here one cannot <strong>filter</strong> a packet, i.e. cannot decide
 to <em>drop</em> or <em>accept it</em>.</li>
<li>The actions taken here are privilege of the <strong>administrator only</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<strong>Filtering</strong> can take place only in the <strong>input</strong>, 
<strong>output</strong> and <strong>forward</strong> stages.
