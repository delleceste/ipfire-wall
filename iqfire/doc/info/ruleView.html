<h3>Linux Routing</h3>

<p>

A packet arrives at your computer always through the <strong>pre routing</strong> block:
 here <cite>linux</cite> decides the future of the new arrived:

<ul>
	<li>it can be destined to our machine and reach the <strong>input</strong>
		 block;</li>
	<li>it can be forwarded to another machine and reach the <strong>forward</strong>
		 block;</li>
	
</ul>

</p>

<p>

A packet is locally generated by your linux computer, for example by your web
browser:

<ul>
	<li>it will pass through the  <strong>output</strong>
		 block;</li>
	
</ul>

</p>

<p>
	Both the <strong>locally generated</strong> packets and the <strong>
	forwarded</strong> ones will pass through the <strong>post routing</strong> block.
</p>

<p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Move</strong> your mouse over the blocks to find out more!!</li>
	<li><strong>Click</strong> on a block to visualize the statistics pertaining to that block.</li>

	</ul>
</p>

		<strong class="note">Note</strong>: to show again the <strong>help</strong> panel after
		 that the statistics were chosen, you must go to the tool bar icon 
		 <strong>?</strong>, <strong>deactivate</strong> it and then <strong>activate</strong>
		  it again.
