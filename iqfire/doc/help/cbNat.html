<h3>Enable NAT globally</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

Check this box if you are going to use the <strong>Network 
	Address Translation (NAT)</strong>
 functionality of <em>iqfire-wall</em>.
 If there are no NAT rules and you have no plans to make the
  software act as a NAT firewall, then disabling this is a 
  good choice, since it speeds up computing.

</p>

<p>
	If this feature is disabled, then all the NAT checks are 
	disabled and the firewall works only as a <strong>packet filter</strong>.
</p>

<p>
	If <em>NAT</em> rules are loaded, but this check box is 
	not enabled, then those rules will not be considered.
