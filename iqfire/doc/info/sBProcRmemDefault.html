<div id="content">

<p>

Should you encounter <em>user/kernel</em> communication problems, 
especially telling you <cite>recvfrom(): no buffer space available</cite>, 
you can try increasing this value, to enlarge the <em>socket receive buffer size</em> used 
to exchange a <em>netlink packet</em> between kernel and user space.

</p>

<p>
	Do not change the default number unless you are very sure and you 
	really encounter a problem like that described above.
	Inside <em>iqfire-wall</em> user interface, you should normally not 
	run into this kind of trouble.
