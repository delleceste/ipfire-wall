<h3>The <em>push</em> flag</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
The <em>Push</em> flag, like the <em>Urgent</em> flag, is made to ensure that the data is given the priority (that it deserves) and is processed at the sending or receiving end. <em>This particular flag is used quite frequently at the beginning and end of a data transfer</em>, affecting the way the data is handled at both ends.


</p>

<p>
The <em>Push</em> bit makes sure the data segment is handled correctly and given the appropriate <em>priority</em> at both ends of a virtual connection. 
</p>

<p>
When a host sends its data, it is temporarily queued in the TCP buffer, a special area in the memory, until the segment has reached a certain size and is then sent to the receiver.<br/>
While this procedure works well in most cases, there are a lot of instances where this <em>
queueing</em> of data is undesirable because any delay during queuing can cause problems to the waiting application. A simple example would be a TCP stream, e.g <em>real player</em>, where data must be sent and processed (by the receiver) immediately to ensure a smooth stream without any cut offs.
