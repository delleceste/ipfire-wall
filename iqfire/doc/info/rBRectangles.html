<h3>Animated rectangles to monitor firewall activity</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

This option draws on the system tray icon two rectangles: the red one represents the amount of 
packets refused by the firewall in the time unit, the green one the accepted ones.

</p>

<p>
  The height of the rectangles is proportional to the number of packets processed 
 in a certain amount of time compared with the mean of the number of packets 
 processed during all the firewall activity.
