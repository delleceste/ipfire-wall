<h3>Create a permission rule from the selected items</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

For each item selected, a <em>new permission rule</em> is added to the firewall.

</p>

<p>
  The rule is built on the basis of the information represented inside the item:
  <ul>
    <li>direction (input or output);</li>
  <li>protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP);</li>
  <li>source and destination <em>IP addresses</em>;</li>
  <li>source and destination <em>ports</em>;</li>
  <li>network interface name;</li>
  <li>the name of the rule you provide (or the default one, not advised!);</li>
  <li>the possibility to be <em>notified by a popup</em> when a rule is applied
      by the firewall to a packet that corresponds to it.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Modifying the contents of a rule</h3>
<p>
  Remember that you can modify the contents of the items in this window to
  create a more generic rule or a rule with different behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  Keep also in mind that normally <em>the source port is ignored</em> when the firewall
adds a rule from the entries listed in this popup. If you want the rule to check against 
the source port, manually provide it - if you know what this implies.
</p>

<h3>Color</h3>
<p>
  The items selected and marked as <strong>Allow</strong> will be 
  bold represented and will assume a <strong>dark green</strong> color.
