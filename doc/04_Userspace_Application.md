# Chapter 4: Userspace Application (ipfire)

The `ipfire` utility is the primary administrative tool for interacting with the kernel-space firewall module.

## 4.1. Core Usage & CLI Flags
The application communicates with the kernel via Netlink sockets using the `IPFI_CONTROL` and `IPFI_DATA` protocols.

| Flag | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `-v` | Version / Status | Shows if the module is loaded and current global settings. |
| `-s` | Statistics | Displays a combined report of kernel per-CPU counters and userspace logging counts. |
| `-X` | Flush | Clears all current filtering rules and resets the state table. |
| `-p <policy>` | Set Policy | Changes the default policy to `accept` or `drop`. |
| `-a <rule>` | Add Rule | Inserts a new rule into the appropriate chain. |

## 4.2. Configuration Files
The application behavior can be customized via config files, typically located in `/etc/ipfire/`.

- `allowed.base`: List of rules to be automatically loaded on startup.
- `ipfire.conf`: Global options such as logging levels, max NAT entries, and stateful tracking defaults.

## 4.3. Interpreting Statistics
The `-s` (Statistics) output is divided into three sections:
1. **Userspace Stats**: Counts of packets actually received and displayed by the tool. Useful for auditing.
2. **Kernel Stats**: High-level counters for `INPUT`, `OUTPUT`, `FORWARD`, and `POST-ROUTING`.
3. **Transmission Health**: Specifically reports `total_lost` (packets the kernel tried to log but couldn't due to buffer pressure).

## 4.4. Logging and Real-time Monitoring
When running, `ipfire` can act as a listener, printing headers for every packet matched by a rule with the `NOTIFY` flag. These logs include:
- Timestamp and user ID.
- Hook location and verdict (ACCEPT/DROP).
- Detailed IP/TCP/UDP header information.
