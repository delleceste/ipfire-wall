<h3>IqFIRE-wall configuration</h3>

<p>	
  In this page some configuration aspects are described and illustrated, to give the user an idea of how much 
    <strong>iqfire-wall</strong> is configurable.
   
</p>	

<p>
  When iqfire-wall is successfully installed, it is already configured to suite the needs of an average user 
  who does not know much of linux and <strong>firewalling</strong>.
  In particular, there are some default policies which:
  <ul>
     <li>allow all the traffic through the local host (<strong>the loopback</strong>);</li>
    <li>allow the <strong>outgoing</strong> traffic generated by your host;</li>
    <li>allow in particular the services:</li>
      <ul>
	    <li>ftp;</li>
	    <li>web browsing;</li>
	    
	    <li>http secure (https);</li>
	    <li><strong>incoming and outgoing</strong> connections to the <strong>secure shell</strong> (ssh) service;</li>
	    <li>Domain Name Service (DNS), to resolve names into internet addresses;</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  These settings should allow a good compromise between network usability and security. As the user becomes more experienced,
  he can personalize the firewall adding or removing rules as he likes.
</p>

<h3>The general configuration page</h3>
<p>
This configuration page is reached by clicking on the <strong>Settings</strong> menu entry and choosing 
<strong>Configure the firewall interface</strong>.

<a href="imgs/uncompressed/confGeneral.jpg"><img src="imgs/confGeneral.jpg" alt="Configuration - general"/></a>
Here one can decide to load the firewall at the moment the desktop is loaded and to startup with the main window
 shown or hidden. The <em>automatic startup function</em> depends on your desktop manager: Gnome and KDE are supported.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>system tray icon</strong> configuration page
<a href="imgs/uncompressed/confSystray.jpg"><img src="imgs/confSystray.jpg" alt="Configuration - system tray"/></a>
The iqfire-wall system tray icon offers some interesting features: an animation and a pair of popups that notify 
various events, such as the arrival of a network packet that the firewall does not know how to treat (there is still
 no rule to manage it) or the match of a packet with a rule that was <em>marked for notification</em>.<br/>
Actually, any rule can be marked for notification and, when a packet matches such a rule, a notification is popped up 
over the system tray icon.
</p>

<p>
The documentation and rulesets paths configuration page
<a href="imgs/uncompressed/confPaths.jpg"><img src="imgs/confPaths.jpg" alt="Configuration - paths"/></a>
The files containig the firewall policies can be put wherever you like in your file system.
The <strong>Firewall Rules</strong> section allows you to personalize the place where the firewall looks for 
the set of rules to load at startup. Remember that this setting <em>requires the software restart</em>.
<br/>
IQFIRE-wall comes with an interactive <strong>help and info system</strong> which provides hints and useful
 pieces of information in association with each element of the user interface (line edits, push buttons, check boxes..).
 The <em>html</em> files containing the help are usually placed in a default position in the iqfire-wall installation 
 directories, but every user can modify the contents or modify the style of the help files (there are <strong>CSS</strong>
 stylesheets associated to the <strong>html</strong> files) in a directory of his own 
 and tell the software to pick up those files in another folder.

<br/>
The information/help widgets change their contents when the user moves the mouse over the elements of the graphical 
interface, but this change takes place after a <strong>delay</strong> which can be set acting on the <strong>
Interactive help/info delay</strong> spin box at the bottom of the window, that can be modified as the user likes, simply 
remembering that the values are intended to represent a delay expressed in <em>milliseconds</em>.

</p>

<p>
The <strong>user interface styles</strong> configuration page
<a href="imgs/uncompressed/confStyles.jpg"><img src="imgs/confStyles.jpg" alt="Configuration - styles"/></a>
The <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt 4</a> graphical libraries allow the personalization of the 
style of each widget by means of a simple <strong>stylesheet</strong> written as a <strong>cascading style sheet</strong>  
document (<strong>CSS</strong>).<br/>
To know how to create personal styles, read the <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/stylesheet.html">Qt Style Sheets</a> 
documentation and create your style sheet as you like. Once you have created your <strong>css</strong> stylesheet, you can 
add the new style to the list and select it to use it.<br/>
You can select one of the <strong>Qt default styles</strong> too.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>updates notification</strong> configuration page
<a href="imgs/uncompressed/confUpdates.jpg"><img src="imgs/confUpdates.jpg" alt="Configuration - updates notification"/></a>
This widget allow configuration of the parameters that provide a notification for software updates.
If you usually connect to an <em>http proxy</em> to browse the world wide web, then you probably need to setup correctly the
 <strong>Http proxy settings</strong> section, providing all the requested parameters to connect to the network http proxy.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>administrator's advanced settings</strong> configuration page
<a href="imgs/uncompressed/confAdvanced.jpg"><img src="imgs/confAdvanced.jpg" alt="Configuration - administrator settings"/></a>
In this page, which is enabled only for the <strong>root</strong> user, the administrator can tune the firewall enabling or
disabling some important features, like <strong>NAT</strong> or the grants given to the normal user.<br/>
Normally, the default installation of <strong>iqfire-wall</strong> sets up a configuration which is likely to suite well the
 needs of the users still fresh to linux firewalling and iqfire-wall.
<br/>As usual for all the elements of the user interface of iqfire-wall, move the mouse over the various elements of this 
window to obtain useful information and some hints on the configuration of this section.
