<h3>The forward block</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
The packets in the <strong>forward</strong> block have arrived from a remote host and are directed towards another machine, not to our one.
They have passed the <strong>pre routing</strong> phase and, if we allow them,
they will jump to the <strong>post routing</strong> stage. Otherwise, if we 
deny the connection, no <strong>forward</strong> action will happen for the packet.
</p>
<p>
Here you can <strong>filter</strong> the network packets that are about to
be forwarded through your computer.
<ul>
<li>One can block a connection <a href="action://adddenialfwd">adding a forward denial rule</a>, or;</li>
<li>forward a connection <a href="action://addpermissionfwd">adding a forward permission rule</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
