<h3>Timeout of the log entries in kernel space</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>

When a packet is printed on the firewall console and the <em>Log level between 
user/kernel</em> option is set to <strong>Smart Log: only unseen packets</strong> 
(on this window, in the section <cite>Verbosity level in kernel/user communication</cite>),
an entry for that packet is allocated in the kernel space and, until that entry is alive 
in the firewall memory, the packet is not printed anymore on the console.


</p>

<p>
	This feature avoids that identical information is repeated and sent between
 	the user and kernel spaces, and reduces the load caused by the console 
	printing system.
</p>

<p>
	Tune this period to obtain a good compromise between performance and 
	the need to view more or less often the same packet information.
</p>

<p>
	The default setting is <em>20 seconds</em> and this implies that, for instance,
	if the console prints a packet information like:
</p>

<p>
	<strong>[OK 17]IN:  [eth0] |TCP| 140.105.4.3:http-alt-->140.105.5.83:60322 |P|A|EST[me -> all the world!]</strong>
</p>

<p>
	the <strong>same</strong> information will be repeated after this <em>timeout</em> 
	has elapsed, if the connection above is still alive, obviously.
</p>
