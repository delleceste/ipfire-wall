<h3>Notify a packet/connection</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
        If this check is ticked, a <strong>popup</strong> will notify that this rule has just been applied.
        The <strong>popup</strong> will normally present a summary of the packet just received and filtered 
	according to its associated rule.


</p>
<p>
	The popup will appear over the <em>iqfire-wall system tray icon</em> and will be shown for a 
	period of time <em>tunable in the <strong>System Tray</strong> tab</em> in this window, in the 
	section <cite>Notify a packet matching a firewall rule</cite>.
</p>

<p>
	If the mouse <em>enters</em> the popup window, it <em>will not be hidden</em>, and will be closed 
	only by pressing the appropriate <cite>close link</cite>.
</p>
<p>
	Only one popup is visible at a time, and if you want to avoid to lock the information 
	displayed at a certain instant, click on the <cite>lock</cite><em>link</em> in the upper part
 	of the popup itself.
</p>
<p>
	Actually, the popup for the <em>matching packets notification</em> is made up of an <em>html
	page</em>.
