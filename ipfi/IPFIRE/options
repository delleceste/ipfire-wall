# Global options for IPFIRE-wall and its GUI version IqFIRE-wall
# This file has been generated by IqFIREWALL and is fully
# compatible with IPFIRE-wall command line version.
# The difference is that IqFIREWALL just considers the administrator's
# options and no more the normal user's ones.
#
# This means that if you mean to use the command line, you must
# uncomment the lines below, in the section
# "Normal user IPFIRE-wall options".
# Such options are always commented out by IqFIREWALL, and so they
# are lost everytime IqFIREWALL writes on this file.
# NOTE: IqFIREWALL never writes on this file if the user is not root!
# For normal users  (that are not root), IqFIREWALL does not consider
# this file.
#
# See the documentation of IPFIRE-wall for further details.
