<h3>Ignore the selected packets</h3>

<div id="content">

<p>
  Ignoring the packets means adding it to the list of the <a 
  href="action://showpendingrules" 
    title="Show the widget with the connections \nwaiting for your authorization">Connections
    waiting for authorization</a>. You can later revise the list and <em>Accept</em> or 
    <em>block</em> its elements.
</p>

<p>
  This is the default behaviour when you directly click the <strong>Ignore All</strong> 
  push button. In that case, <strong>all</strong> the elements are added to the 
   list of the <a 
  href="action://showpendingrules" 
    title="Show the widget with the connections \nwaiting for your authorization">Connections
    waiting for authorization</a>.

  This brings two main advantages:
  <ol>
    <li>you can decide later on, in a moment's peace, the lot of the packets;</li>
    <li>you avoid that the same packets continue being enqueued to the popup.</li>
  </ol>

  
</p>

<p>
  Remember that <em>to the ignored packets the <strong>default policy of the firewall</strong>
  is applied</em>. This means that <em>no rule is inserted into the firewall's policies 
  for the ignored packets</em>.
